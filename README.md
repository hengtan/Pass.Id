# Project Overview

This project is a **TypeScript-based server application**, potentially functioning as a web API. It utilizes **Fastify**, a high-performance, low-overhead web framework for Node.js. 

## Database Operations

Database operations are managed through **Prisma**, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. This is evidenced by the `prisma` and `@prisma/client` dependencies, along with the `db:migrate` and `db:studio` scripts.

## TypeScript Handling

The TypeScript source code is built using **tsup**, while **tsx** is employed for direct execution of TypeScript files. 

## Server Features

The server supports **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** and utilizes **Swagger** for API documentation. This is indicated by the `@fastify/cors`, `@fastify/swagger`, and `@fastify/swagger-ui` dependencies.

## Schema Validation

Schema validation is managed through **Zod**, as suggested by the `fastify-type-provider-zod` dependency. 

## Server Functionality

The specific server functionality would be determined by the code within the `src` directory, which is not visible in the provided excerpt.
